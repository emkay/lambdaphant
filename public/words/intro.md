The idea here is to keep a list of places I am on the internets. Sometimes I may write stuff down.

### The Breakdown

There is a menu on the left that should show you the places I frequent. It also has an about section which might be more substantial one day. It's pretty bare now. Actually don't even look at it. I have a bunch of old posts from various incarnations of this site that I will probably never put up. I just don't really want to put in the time.

### What I've Been Working On

For months now I've been working on the new version of [Yahoo! News](http://news.yahoo.com). It was launched yesterday, and seems to be getting some good press. I'm pretty proud of it.

For the last year and change I've been helping out as an organizer of [js.la](http://js.la). If you're around the Los Angeles area and love javascript you should come on out.

### Closing

Some of this should probably be in the about section, but what else would I write about here for a first post type thing?
