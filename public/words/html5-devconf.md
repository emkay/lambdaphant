[HTML5 Dev Conf](http://html5devconf.com/) is a two day event that brings together the web community to listen to speakers rattle on about the latest and greatest in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

Full notes about the conference are on [github](https://github.com/emkay/html5-dev-conf-2013/).

## Initial Thoughts
I had fun. I met some cool folks, and hung out with some friends. Overall the talks felt like they were advertisements for whatever company the presenter worked for.
There were of course exceptions. That's not to say they were __bad__ advertisements. For example, my favorite talk was [Always Bet On JS: The Convergence of Operating System and Browser](http://slid.es/nickdesaulniers/jsos) and it was mainly about what's new with [Firefox Nightly](http://nightly.mozilla.org/) and the dev tools.

## The Good
The talks that I really liked were:

* [Always Bet On JS: The Convergence of Operating System and Browser by Nick Desaulniers](http://slid.es/nickdesaulniers/jsos)
* [Which Way is Forward by Doug Crockford](https://github.com/emkay/html5-dev-conf-2013/blob/master/day2.md#which-way-is-forward)
* [Creating Cross-Platform Games with One HTML5 Code Base by Tyler Smith](https://github.com/emkay/html5-dev-conf-2013/blob/master/day1.md#creating-cross-platform-games-with-one-html5-code-base)

These talks either showcased some very interesting tech, or made me think about ideas in a different way.

## The Bad
I'm not going to pick on any specific talks, but there were quite a few that I didn't like.

The main problem that I had with them is they didn't tell a good story about what they did with html 5, css, and js. Some talks had very intelligent people talking about build tools and hiring. I wanted to hear more about the technical aspects of their companies journey. 

## Conclusion
I expected a lot more. The speaker list was awesome. The talks were not. Would rather have been at [js.la](http://js.la).
