<p class="interview-intro">Steve "The Huff" Huffman is a co-founder at <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com/">Hipmunk</a> with Adam Goldstein. He also co-founded <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, which was sold in 2006. Both Reddit and Hipmunk went through the <a href=http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> seed funding process. In this brief interview he talks about how he got started hacking, the comparison between both Y Combinator experiences, and some insight into the <a href="http://hipmunk.com">Hipmunk</a> development process.</p>

<p class="question">How did you get started hacking?</p>
<p class="answer">My dad got me started with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC programming</a> when I was 8 or so. I learned most from programming magazines. One of the formative books I read was "The Super Computer Snooper" by Dr. Isaac Malitz. It was geared towards children, but covered fairly advanced topics (like writing self-modifying programs), all in BASIC.</p>

<p class="question">What advice would you give to kids interested in programming?</p>
<p class="answer">I feel like kids don't need advice as much as they need guidance. Unfortunately, it seems harder to learn how to program these days than when I was a kid. I hope there's a great Python-tutorial-for-kids out there, but it's been a while since I learned :)</p>

<p class="question">How did you meet Adam Goldstein?</p>
<p class="answer">We met at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp">FOO camp</a> in the summer of 2005, and we stayed in touch over the years. He lived with me for a summer while working on another startup in San Francisco.</p>

<p class="question">How did you guys come about the idea for <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com">Hipmunk</a>?</p>
<p class="answer">Adam called me in the spring of this year (2010) with the idea. He was about to graduate from MIT and wanted to start a company. Conveniently, I was also looking to start another company. It wasn't a tough sell from him to convince me that existing travel search sites were atrocious. What took some convincing was that we should throw our hat in the ring. Obviously, he won.</p>

<p class="question">How did the Hipmunk Y Combinator experience compare to the Reddit experience?</p>
<p class="answer">The two experiences are totally different. YC was a lot smaller during the reddit days. Alexis (reddit co-founder) and I were just learning the ropes. YC was still figuring out their role in things. There were only 8 startups in that first YC batch, but there were 36 in this last one. Demo day is a <b>*much*</b> bigger deal now than it was in 2005 as well.</p>
<p class="answer">The most important parts of YC, the camaraderie with other startups and mentorship from Paul and Co. have stayed constant, however.</p>

<p class="question">Being that you already had a successful startup with Reddit, it probably made getting some angels on board a bit easier. I'm sure you still have some insight into funding though. What advice can you give to those founders who find themselves looking for angel funding?</p>
<p class="answer">You need less money than you think, so build as much as you can without funding. The most compelling argument you can make to an investor is to appear to not need their money. I feel like a lot of people use lack of angel funding as an excuse to not actually build something, as if suddenly having a few thousand dollars would make them instantly better at building things.</p>

<p class="question">What is the Hipmunk development cycle like?</p>
<p class="answer">We write code until we aren't embarrassed to show it publicly. It's not a complex system: we have a list of things to do, and a group of people who do them. I like to talk about code, so we do a lot of code reviews in the process.</p>

<p class="question">Do you use unit tests?</p>
<p class="answer">No. We're not philosophically opposed to them, but for most of the stuff we write, it would cost us more in time than it would save.</p>

<p class="question">How often do you push out code?</p>
<p class="answer">Every couple of days. We usually push code in the mornings so people will be around to see if things are breaking.</p>

<p class="question">What does the Hipmunk architecture look like?</p>
<p class="answer">Everything is in <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>. We use <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado</a> and <a href="http://memcached.org/">memcached</a>. We are starting to integrate <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> for some new features.</p>

<p class="question">Any good books you are reading now or have recently read?</p>
<p class="answer">I recently finished <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dgun_(novel)">Shogun by James Clavell</a>, which was an epic epic.</p>
