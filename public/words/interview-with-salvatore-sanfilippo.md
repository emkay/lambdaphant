<p class="interview-intro">This interview is with <a href="http://antirez.com/">Salvatore Sanfilippo</a>, possibly better known as <a href="http://github.com/antirez">antirez</a>. He is the creator of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/">Redis</a> and earlier this year was hired by <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a> to work on it full time.</p>
<p class="question">How did you get started programming?</p>
<p class="answer">When I was about 6 my father bought a Texas Instrument <a href="http://utopia.knoware.nl/users/stuurmn/ti94a.htm">TI94/4A</a>, since he was a geek. Personal Computing was a very popular hobby in the Sicily of 80s, together with electronics. I was barely able to write but already started copying programs from the user manual to the TI94 with great satisfaction when at the end I typed "RUN". :)</p>

<p class="question">What was your first big programming project?</p>
<p class="answer">When I was 10 I wrote a software for the local supermarket, in order to handle the warehouse, orders, and so forth. I sold this program for something like 50.000 Italian lire, that is more or less... 30 US dollars of today. The program was completely written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC">GW-BASIC</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_programming_language">BASIC</a> interpreter very popular in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS">DOS</a> environments at the time.</p>

<p class="question">You went to college for architecture, what made you swap over to writing programs instead of buildings?</p>
<p class="answer">Two things mainly. The first was the little interest most of the other college students where paying: their main problem was to pass the exams, not understanding. This started boring me a lot.</p>
<p class="answer">Another factor was that the first exams I gave where all about math, physics, and other technical stuff. I was about 20 at the time, and the latest time I programmed something was many years ago, maybe when I was 14. In the space between 14 and 20 I completely quit programming because I was much more interested in going outside, girls, and so forth. ;)</p>
<p class="answer">But thanks to the fact I was studying math I needed something to plot function graphs, so I started using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC">QuickBASIC</a> to write a function plotting program able to identify local minima, inversion points, to trace the derivative, and other simple things.</p>
<p class="answer">Then QuickBASIC started to be not enough, I finally installed a Linux CD, and started learning C. After some time I <a href="http://seclists.org/bugtraq/1998/May/139">published a security bug report on bugtraq about the ping utility</a>.</p>
<p class="answer">Thanks to this bug report I got a call from Milan, there was a team of security experts looking for people, so I left Palermo where I was studying and joined the "SECLAB" in Milano. This experience was very short but very important, after six months I returned home because I did not like the life in north Italy, but in the meantime I wrote the <a href="http://www.hping.org/">hping security tool</a> and learned a lot more new things.</p>

<p class="question">It looks like you had some success with your start-up <a href="http://merzia.com/">Merzia</a>, developing some slick web apps. Do you miss working on those, or does Redis more than make up for that?</p>
<p class="answer">Redis is definitely a better experience for me, because I love system programming. Web programming is awesome because you can build a product and in a few months if everything goes ok you see many users using your web program, suggesting you the direction to take. So I loved web programming, but I enjoy more system programming, and in general fields where there is to contribute something new. Security back in 1998 was the "new thing", there was a lot of space for contributing your ideas, I think that this is now happening with databases and messaging technologies.</p>

<p class="question">When you were working on the start-ups what marketing tactics did you use to gain traction?</p>
<p class="answer">It was very simple for me and my cofounder to get traction because when we build our web 2.0 applications we where absolutely the first guys doing this in Italy. So all the Italian blogosphere got excited to finally try something that was similar to what was happening in the rest of the world. What we tried to do was to recreate services that were working well in US, but where the localization was very important, so we started writing a system very similar to <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>/<a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> and one like <a href="http://www.delicious.com/">Delicious</a> but enhancing this services accordingly to our vision of things. For instance <a href="http://oknotizie.virgilio.it/">Oknotizie</a> featured the ability for users to open a "sub-oknotizie" with a specific topic before <a href"http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> itself.</p>

<p class="question">VMWare hired you earlier this year to work on Redis full time. Has this allowed you to move forward with the Redis Book or are you just working on Redis and <a href="http://github.com/antirez/redis-tools">Redis Tools</a>?</p>
<p class="answer">Since VMware hired me, and hired <a href="http://github.com/pietern">Pieter Noordhuis</a> as a contractor, the development speed is something like four times faster :) This was the most interesting change. And finally the book project is evolving. I, Pieter Noordhuis and <a href="http://github.com/tnm">Ted Nyman</a> are in the process of writing a book on Redis for O'Reilly. We definitely need some passionate programmer to take care of Redis Tools...</p>

<p class="question">What programs are you excited about right now? (besides Redis)</p>
<p class="answer">I'm very excited about the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby language</a>. I care a lot about programming languages, and learned/tried a number of languages in the past, but Ruby is the first very high level language that features a lot of good things, with a lot of taste, from functional programming, object oriented programming, and imperative programming. I think that languages evolution follows two parallel binaries: one is where you experiment with new ideas, and one is where you take all the valid ideas and consolidate them into a very usable language. Ruby is one of my preferred "consolidating" language.</p>
<p class="answer">Another thing I'm excited is event driven programming, that with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, <a href="http://rubyeventmachine.com/">Event Machine</a>, and other systems is finally going to become mainstream. In the past I used to write a lot of code in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">Tcl</a>, that is an evented programming language since the start. I always loved this programming style. I also hope that the idea that in very high level languages like Ruby different threads should run different interpreters with a message passing semantics will eventually win.</p>
<p class="answer">Finally, I don't like how Apple is behaving recently, but I love their design effort with the iPhone user interface. It was shocking how mobile devices software sucked. Now this is mostly fixed...</p>
