#### The Autobiography of Malcolm X: As Told to Alex Haley

This book has been on my list of things to read for a while and once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. The entire thing is incredible, and there are hardly any dull moments. No matter what you think of the politics behind the man, the story is fascinating.

#### Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West (Vintage International)

Holy fuck. Violence. History. An ending that I have no idea how to interpret. Must read for everyone.

#### Comics

The other three books I read were comics, and I enjoyed them all. Not sure what to say about them though. I'm still trying to process the other two books I read.

### CS Papers

I'm sort of following [the list fogus put together](http://blog.fogus.me/2011/09/08/10-technical-papers-every-programmer-should-read-at-least-twice/).

This month I read the first two on the list.

* [Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages by Christopher Strachey](http://www.itu.dk/courses/BPRD/E2009/fundamental-1967.pdf)
* [Why Functional Programming Matters by John Hughes](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html)

[Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages](http://www.itu.dk/courses/BPRD/E2009/fundamental-1967.pdf) was crazy to read. There is a lot of gold in this paper, and it took me a while to get through it and understand it all. This paper is from 1967 making it just shy of 50 years old and it is still useful to read. It starts out by going over some basic concepts, such as, assignment, left and right values, names, and numbers. From the start Strachey makes some philisophical notes about the problems of naming specific terms and how they mean different things to different people. Because of this we need to be very careful about what we name things. Variables, polymorphism, lists, dynamic type, and a ton of other things are discussed as well. A lot of these concepts had to be very new. Read it.

[Why Functional Programming Matters](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html) was very interesting as well. It goes over a lot of common functional programming concepts. What I got out of it is that functional programming is awesome because higher order functions and lazy evaluation allow you to write code that is more modular than you would normally write. Because of that your programs are simpler to understand, maintain, etc.
