<a href="http://github.com/mojombo">Tom</a> is the creator of <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>, which was bought by <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, and cofounder of <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>. Most recently he gave a <a href="http://www.justin.tv/startupschool/b/272178966">talk at Startup School 2010</a> and gave a follow up <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1804443">ask me anything</a> on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">HN</a>.
### How did you get started in programming?

When I was nine years old my family bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80">TRS-80 computer</a>. It had no operating system or hard drive. But it did have a built-in text editor and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> interpreter that you could fire up and write programs with. We had a few books on BASIC and I'd sit and laboriously type in programs line for line, hoping to get some kind of simple text-based game if I'd done everything correctly. After a few successful programs I started to read further into the book trying to understand what each line of the program was doing and what would happen if I modified a constant or string of text. Once you realize the power that writing computer programs gives you, it's hard to stop experimenting and before long I was writing my own programs and doing simple graphical animations.

### What advice would you give to kids interested in programming now?

Learn web programming. You can start with simple web pages written in HTML and then as you learn, start adding dynamic functionality with JavaScript. With this foundation you can branch out into web frameworks or graphic design or usability and have a really solid foundation for an entire lifetime of learning and making a living for yourself. At the same time, these skills lend themselves very well towards being an entrepreneur and helping to define what the future looks like. That's pretty powerful.

### I really like this quote of yours: "It was hard to think of the situation as anything but a huge failure, but the shitstorm the downtime was causing indicated that people found the service valuable." It reminds me that having scaling issues are a good problem to have, especially when you are a regular guy with a server, some code, and a vision. It must be hard to realize that when you all you are getting is hate mail. A lot of people would have given up faced with a similar situation. What was the key to sticking it out with <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a> even though it was costing you money and hate mail?

It was a mixture of pride and stubbornness. I'm ok with abandoning a project that nobody uses, but to give up on something that is clearly useful and rapidly growing in popularity is not something that I am capable of doing. I have too much pride in what I do to just throw away an opportunity simply because it's painful at the moment. I knew there was a solution, I just hadn't found it yet. So I hunkered down and wrote the code necessary to make the service work without having to shell out thousands of dollars for servers. In the meantime I started looking for companies that might be interested in buying Gravatar and that would have the resources necessary to scale it and take it to the next level. <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> turned out to be exactly the right fit. Though they declined the first time I talked with them, my persistence paid off and Gravatar became their first acquisition six months later.

### What advice would you give to someone thinking about joining/founding a startup?

Do it. You'll learn more in a year as a founder than you will in a lifetime of working for a big corporation. Joining a young startup is similar, but not quite as wild a ride as being a founder. In either case you're at the leading edge of the company defining what it will become. You have your fingers in a hundred different pies and get to work on the most interesting thing of all: something you've created. In his amazing book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594488843?ie=UTF8&tag=freeagentnati-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594488843">Drive</a>, <a href="http://www.danpink.com/">Dan Pink</a> asserts that there are three elements that make work fulfilling: Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose. Founding a company is the perfect way to satisfy these requirements and build a place where others can find these same benefits. That's real value.

### <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> has grown into a site that tons of hackers are now using to push, fork, and find software. In the beginning how did you gain traction?

San Francisco is a great place to meet people. When I moved here I started attending the Ruby meetups every two weeks. This is where I met my cofounders <a href="http://github.com/defunkt">Chris</a> and <a href="http://github.com/pjhyett">PJ</a>. As we worked on GitHub, we started showing it off to fellow attendees and gave them all invitations to the beta. <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/">Yehuda Katz</a> was the first external GitHub user and officially moved <a href="http://www.merbivore.com/">Merb</a> to the site very early on. Merb was very popular at the time and got us a lot of exposure in the Ruby community. In addition, Chris and PJ and I all put our extensive list of open source code on the site and got our friends from all over to sign up and start using it to contribute to our projects.

### Are there any similarities, or maybe drastic differences from your experience with Gravatar and GitHub?

I made a lot of mistakes with Gravatar that I've not repeated with GitHub. Here are a few:

Gravatar was not created with any sort of business plan in mind. It was simply a fun project that I thought would be a great way for me to contribute to the budding world of weblogs. When it became popular, it became unsustainable since I couldn't come up with a way to monetize it.
As the solo founder of Gravatar, I didn't have anyone to act as a sounding board for ideas. Because of this I made stupid decisions such as insisting that I manually rate every new Gravatar for inappropriate content instead of letting users rate their own submissions. In addition, without a second person to motivate me and contribute time to the project, I was constantly struggling to keep ahead of the traffic curve.
Knowing what I know now, I could have easily taken some angel or VC money with the ideas that I had around Gravatar. Back then I didn't have a lot of contacts in the startup world and I lived in San Diego where VC money is much harder to come by.
One element of Gravatar that did work, and that GitHub employs is that of virality. With Gravatar, you see avatars on blog posts and you want to get one of your own. With GitHub, your friends send you links to their projects and you want to get the same great features for yourself. In both cases, advertising is built in and the services spread themselves without constant external marketing.

### When you're hacking, music with or without words?

I listen to a wide variety of electronic, drum and bass, and dubstep music when I'm hacking. Words don't really affect me one way or the other. As long as there's a good beat, I can get into the zone.

### What's your favorite book?

Of all the books I've read, I can't pick just one, but if I narrow the category to books about entrepreneurship, I'd have to say <a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/">Founders and Work</a> by <a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/author.html">Jessica Livingston</a> is one of my favorites. It's a series of interviews she did with founders of well known companies like PayPal, Apple, and Hewlett-Packard. It's fascinating and inspiring to hear how these companies got started and see that their founders and not so different from you and I.
